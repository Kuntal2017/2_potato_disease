End to End project
2 diseases in potato plant are
1. early blight  -caused by fungus  
2. late blight - caused by micro-organism
Treatment for both the disease is different.


Steps 
1. Data collection-- collection of images of potato leaf
	(healthy,early blight ,late blight)
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
	2.1-- using tf dataset
	2.2 data augmentation(for generation of more data)
3. Model building using - CNN
4. Export model in local disk
5. running tf server on this models--tf serving will called from api
6. Website development using Reactjs
7. For mobile deployment -- we convert this models to tf-lite models
	using quantization(reducing the speed of the model).
